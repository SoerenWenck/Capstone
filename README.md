# ðŸ©º Capstone Project â€“ Lifestyle-Factors Influencing Hypertension

This project explores the key factors that influence blood pressure, with a particular focus on hypertension. Through exploratory data analysis, interactive dashboards, and machine learning, we uncover patterns and correlations in health and lifestyle data.

## ðŸ“Š Project Objective

The main goals of this analysis were:

- To explore how **physical activity**, **alcohol consumption**, **smoking** affect blood pressure  
- To examine variations across **age**, **gender**, and **ethnicity**  
- To identify combinations of factors most associated with **hypertension**  
- To build a **machine learning model** that predicts hypertension risk

## ðŸ§® Data Overview

The dataset consists of federated health-related data including demographic, lifestyle, and biometric features. Key variables include:

- **Demographics**: Age, Gender, Ethnicity  
- **Lifestyle**: Physical activity level, Sitting time, Alcohol use, Smoking status  
- **Health**: Systolic & Diastolic Blood Pressure, Pulse, BMI, Waist circumference  
- **Medical**: Medication use, Hypertension diagnosis

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Dashboards

The Tableau workbook contains more than 30 visualizations. Key dashboards include:

- **Age + Blood Pressure** â€“ Correlation between age and BP  
- **BMI, Pulse, Waist** â€“ Body metrics and their impact on cardiovascular health  
- **Hypertension by Gender & Ethnicity** â€“ Distribution across subgroups  
- **Smoking & Alcohol** â€“ Influence on systolic and diastolic pressure  
- **Random Forest** â€“ Machine learning model for predicting hypertension  
- **Recommendations** â€“ Health behavior suggestions based on findings  
- **Data Preparation Journey** â€“ Feature selection and cleaning steps

## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Component

We trained a **Random Forest classifier** to predict the likelihood of a person having hypertension. Features used include:

- Age, Gender, BMI, Smoking, Alcohol, Sport activity, Sedentary time, etc.

This model helped uncover hidden patterns and supported the insights from the EDA.

## âœ… Key Insights

Some of the main takeaways include:

- Regular **physical activity** is associated with lower blood pressure  
- **Smokers** and **heavy drinkers** have higher BP on average  
- Blood pressure **increases significantly with age**  
- **BMI** is a strong predictor of systolic blood pressure  
- The RF model showed promising accuracy in classifying hypertension risk

## ðŸ‘¥ Team

This project was completed as part of a Capstone in [Data Analyst Consulting / NeueFische / Bootcamp]. Analysis and visualization were done using **Tableau**, **Python (for EDA & RF)** and **SQL** (for merging Datasets).
